		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Metronome Book (the "App") is a mobile application developed by Marcin Karwat (the "Developer"). The
			purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform users of the App ("Users") about the types of data that the App
			may collect, how it is processed, and how it is protected. The Developer takes the privacy of its Users
